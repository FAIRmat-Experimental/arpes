More advanced plotting techniques in PyARPES
============================================

In addition to the ones discussed previously, certain types of more
complicated plots frequently encountered in ARPES analyses are included
out of the box.

As a general workflow rule of thumb, you can either use these techniques
as a starting point, modifying the axes and objects returned before
saving your figure, or copy the code or technique for a one off figure
that requires more customization.

If you encounter a use case you think should be supported, get in
contact with Conrad and he can add the functionality, or become a
`contributor </contributing>`__.

PyARPES plotting routines and techniques
----------------------------------------

-  `Stacked EDC/line plots </stack-plots>`__
-  `Fermi surfaces </fermi-surfaces>`__
-  `3D cut plots </3d-cut-plots>`__
-  `Dispersion plots </dispersion-plots>`__
-  `Spin-ARPES plots </spin-arpes>`__
-  `Ultrafast-ARPES plots </tr-arpes>`__

Finally, there is a discussion on:
